An app to write faster.

I am challenging myself to create this app to practice JavaScript.

### Creating an App to Learn How to Type Faster

#### 1. Planning
**Define Objectives:** Create an app to learn how to type faster by typing words proposed by the app as quickly as possible within a set time limit.

**Research and Analysis:** Study similar applications in a professional context to identify strengths and weaknesses.

**Establish a Specification:** Document the basic features, such as random word selection, a timer, tracking statistics, and difficulty levels.

#### 2. Design
**User Interface (UI) Design:**
- **Home Screen:** Buttons to start the game, view statistics, and access settings.
- **Game Screen:** Input area to type words, list of words to type, timer, and real-time score display.
- **Results Screen:** Display performance, option to replay or return to the home screen.

**User Experience (UX):**
- Simplify the interface for easy access to main features.
- Ensure instant feedback when the user types a word correctly or incorrectly.

**Choose Technologies:**
- **Front-end:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (e.g., React for the UI). As a beginner, I will stick to classic JS.
- **Back-end:** Node.js, Express for the server, MongoDB for the database (if needed for storing user statistics) for a future update.

#### 3. Development
**Project Initialization:**
- Set up a Git repository for version control.
- Set up the development environment.

**Front-end:**
- Create UI components (Home, Game, Results).
- Develop the random word generation system.
- Implement the timer and score calculation.
- Add CSS styles to make the app visually appealing and responsive.

**Back-end:**
- Develop an API to manage words, scores, and user statistics.
- Implement user authentication (if necessary).
- Ensure communication between the front-end and back-end.

**Integration:**
- Connect the front-end and back-end.
- Test end-to-end functionality to ensure everything works together correctly.

#### 4. Testing
**Unit Tests:**
- Test individual front-end components (e.g., verify the timer works correctly).
- Test back-end API endpoints.

**Integration Tests:**
- Ensure the front-end communicates correctly with the back-end.
- Test the complete user flow, from word selection to score calculation.

**User Interface Tests:**
- Conduct user tests to ensure the interface is intuitive and easy to use.

**Performance Tests:**
- Ensure the app runs quickly, even with many users.

#### 5. Deployment
**Preparation for Deployment:**
- Optimize code (minification, image size reduction, etc.).
- Configure production and development environments.

**Deployment:**
- Deploy the front-end on a platform like Netlify or Vercel.
- Deploy the back-end on Heroku or AWS.

**Post-Deployment Monitoring:**
- Monitor performance and fix bugs quickly.
- Gather user feedback for future improvements.

#### 6. Maintenance and Updates
**Bug Fixes:**
- Respond to bug reports and fix them quickly.

**Updates:**
- Add new features (e.g., difficulty levels, new words).
- Improve the user interface and user experience.

**User Support:**
- Provide help and answer user questions.
- Maintain a FAQ and user guides.
